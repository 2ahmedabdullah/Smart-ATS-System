# Application-Tracking-System-Powered-by-Groq-Llama-70B ⚡

An AI-native, ultra-high-speed Applicant Tracking System (ATS) matching, semantic scoring, and automated candidate remediation pipeline. This architecture leverages **Meta's Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile** via **Groq's LPU cloud infrastructure** paired with **Pydantic** data contracts to achieve deep semantic parsing and structured schema delivery in seconds.

## 🚀 The Performance Leap
* **Legacy Architecture (Local Qwen-2.5-7B Engine):** ~600 seconds (10 minutes) per document due to localized VRAM throughput bounds and sequential extraction loops.
* **Optimized Groq-Llama-70B Architecture:** **Under 15 seconds** total execution time for a concurrent multi-document compilation (**100x speedup**).

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

1. **Layout-Agnostic Resume Ingestion:** A single-pass, zero-hardcoded JSON segmentation layer. It effortlessly parses complex multi-column resumes, graphics, and chaotic layouts, isolating chronological professional blocks without dropping context.
2. **Dynamic Taxonomy Alignment:** Instead of relying on a rigid, outdated keyword list, the system takes the incoming Job Description (JD) text and dynamically builds a runtime evaluation matrix.
3. **Semantic Vector Matching:** Bypasses fragile exact-string matching by running localized text embeddings (`nomic-embed-text`) to map synonyms, related software stacks, and conceptual domain alignments.
4. **Contextual Skill Remediation:** Isolates core technical missing gaps and programmatically engineers high-impact, professional resume bullet points mapped natively to specific historical career blocks (enforcing strict business rules against generic definitions).

## 📐 System Architecture & Data Flow

The engine utilizes an asynchronous thread pool to read, segment, and normalize both incoming files simultaneously before executing downstream vector math and strategic bullet remediation:
